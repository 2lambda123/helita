Installation
************

Pre-requisites
==============


To make use of helita the you must first install the following:

 * [Python](http://www.python.org) (2.7.x, 3.4.x or later)
 * [Astropy](http://astropy.org)
 * [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
 * [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)

In addition, the following packages are also recommended to take advantage of all the features:

* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) (1.1+)
* [netCDF4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)
* [Cython](http://www.cython.org)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [beautifulsoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

All of the above packages are available through [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/), and that is the recommended way of setting up your Python distribution.

Cloning git repository
======================

The easiest way is to use git to clone the repository. To grab the latest version of helita and install it:

    git clone https://github.com/ITA-solar/helita.git
    cd helita
    python setup.py install


Non-root install
----------------

If you don't have write permission to your Python packages directory, use the following option with `setup.py`:

    python setup.py install --user

This will install helita under your home directory (typically `~/.local`).

Developer install
-----------------

If you want to install helita but also actively change the code or contribute to its development, it is recommended that you do a developer install instead:

    python setup.py develop

This will set up the package such as the source files used are from the git repository that you cloned (only a link to it is placed on the Python packages directory). Can also be combined with the `--user` flag for local installs.
